Dr. Ganga G.C
Lecturer of Trichandra Multiple Campus
PhD in Microbiology | Researcher | Educator | Science Communicator

Welcome to my personal website! 
my strong passion for exploring the unseen world of microorganisms and their profound impact on health, environment, and industry.

My academic journey has taken me through years of research focused on topics such as microbial genetics, antibiotic resistance, infectious diseases, and environmental microbiology. During my doctoral studies and beyond, Iâ€™ve worked on multidisciplinary projects that connect microbiology with biotechnology, public health, and sustainability.

ðŸ§¬ My Work
I specialize in:

Microbial pathogenesis and host-microbe interactions

Antimicrobial resistance mechanisms

Environmental and agricultural microbiology

Laboratory diagnostics and molecular techniques

Iâ€™ve authored peer-reviewed publications, contributed to collaborative research initiatives, and mentored students in both academic and lab environments. Whether in the lab or in the classroom, I strive to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and real-world application.

ðŸ“š Beyond Research
Outside of my core research, I am also passionate about:

Science education and public engagement

Scientific writing and communication

Advocating for responsible science and innovation

I regularly participate in seminars, outreach events, and educational programs to help make microbiology more accessible and engaging for all audiences.

ðŸŒ¿ Personal Interests
When Iâ€™m not immersed in research, I enjoy:

Reading science non-fiction and historical biographies

Hiking and spending time in nature

Trying out new cooking techniques and cuisines

Sharing microbiology facts with anyone who will listen!
